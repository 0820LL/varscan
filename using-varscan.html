<h2>VarScan User's Manual</h2>

VarScan is coded in Java, and should be executed from the command line 
(Terminal, in Linux/UNIX/OSX, or Command Prompt in MS Windows). 
For variant calling, you will need a pileup file. See the <A HREF="#pileup-howto">How to Build A Pileup File</A> section for details.
Running 
VarScan with no arguments prints the usage information. Because some fields changed as of VarScan v2.2.3, we are providing updated 
documentations for the current release. For documentation of v2.2.2 and prior, see below.

</pre>
Note that more specific options (e.g. min-coverage-normal) will override the default or specificied value of less specific options (e.g. min-coverage). 
<BR /><BR />
The <strong>normal and tumor purity</strong> values should be a value between 0 and 1. The default (1) implies that the normal is 100% pure with no contaminating tumor 
cells, and the tumor is 100% pure with no contaminating stromal or other non-malignant cells. You would change tumor-purity to something less than 1 if you
have a low-purity tumor sample and thus expect lower variant allele frequencies for mutations. You would change normal-purity to something less than 1 only
if it's possible that there will be some tumor content in your "normal" sample, e.g. adjacent normal tissue for a solid tumor, malignant blood cells in the 
skin punch normal for some liquid tumors, etc.
<BR /><BR />
There are <strong>two p-value options</strong>. One (p-value) is the significance threshold for the first-pass algorithm that determines, for each position, if either normal 
or tumor is variant at that position. The second (somatic-p-value) is more important; this is the threshold below which read count differences between tumor and normal 
are deemed significant enough to classify the sample as a somatic mutation or an LOH event. In the case of a shared (germline) variant, this p-value is used to
determine if the combined normal and tumor evidence differ significantly enough from the null hypothesis (no variant with same coverage) to report the variant. See the <A HREF="http://varscan.sourceforge.net/somatic-calling.html" TITLE="Exome-based somatic mutation detection"><strong>somatic mutation calling</strong></A> section for details.

	--min-map-qual - Minimum read mapping quality to count for coverage [20]
	--min-coverage - Minimum coverage threshold for copynumber segments [20]
	--min-segment-size - Minimum number of consecutive bases to report a segment [10]
	--max-segment-size - Max size before a new segment is made [100]
	--p-value - P-value threshold for significant copynumber change-point [0.01]
	--data-ratio - The normal/tumor input data ratio for copynumber adjustment [1.0]
</pre>
Note: The data ratio is intended to help you account for overall differences in the amount of sequencing coverage
between normal and tumor, which might otherwise give the appearance of global copy number differences. If normal 
has more data than tumor, set this to something greater than 1. If tumor has more data than normal, adjust it to 
something below 1. A basic formula for data ratio might be something like <I>ratio = normal_unique_bp / tumor_unique_bp</I>
where unique base pairs are computed as <I>mapped_non_dup_reads * read_length</I>.
<pre class="sequenceTextSmall">	 
	OUTPUT
	chrom				Chromosome name
	chr_start			Region start position (1-based from the pileup)
	chr_stop			Region stop position (1-based from the pileup)
    num_positions		Size of the region in base pairs
    normal_depth		Average normal sequence depth for the region
    tumor_depth			Average tumor sequence depth for the region
    log2_ratio			Log-base-2 ratio of: adjusted tumor depth over normal depth
    gc_content			Estimated GC content of the region (0-100)
</pre>

The raw regions reported by VarScan are delineated by drops in coverage or changes in the tumor/normal ratio, so there are many small, nearby regions with similar copy number.
It is therefore recommended that raw VarScan copynumber output be processed with circular binary segmentation (CBS) or a similar algorithm, which will generate larger segments
delineated by statistically significant change points. See the <A HREF="http://varscan.sourceforge.net/copy-number-calling.html" TITLE="Exome-based copy number calling"><strong>copy number calling</strong></A> section for details.

<BR>
The variant calling features of VarScan for single samples (pileup2snp, pileup2indel, pileup2cns) and multiple samples 
(mpileup2snp, mpileup2indel, mpileup2cns, and somatic) expect input in 
SAMtools <A HREF="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml" target="_blank">pileup</A> or <A HREF="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml" target="_blank">mpileup</A> format. <span style="color: #FF0000"><strong>In current versions of SAMtools, the "pileup" command has now been replaced with the "mpileup" command</strong></span>. For a single sample, these operate in a very similar fashion, except that mpileup applies BAQ adjustments by default, and the output is identical. When you give it 
multiple BAM files, however, SAMtools mpileup generates a multi-sample pileup format that must be processed with the mpileup2* commands in VarScan. 
To build a mpileup file, you will need:
<UL>
<LI>One or more <strong>BAM</strong> files ("myData.bam") that have been sorted using the <I>sort</I> command of SAMtools.</LI>
<LI>The <strong>reference sequence</strong> ("reference.fasta") to which reads were aligned, in FASTA format.</LI>
<LI>The <A HREF="http://samtools.sourceforge.net" TARGET="_blank"><strong>SAMtools</strong></A> software package.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
Generate a mpileup file with the following command:
<pre class="sequenceTextSmall">

samtools mpileup -f [reference sequence] [BAM file(s)] >myData.mpileup
</pre>
<BR>Note, to save disk space and file I/O, you can redirect mpileup output directly 
to VarScan with a "pipe" command. For example:
<BR>
<pre class="sequenceTextSmall">
One sample:
samtools mpileup -f reference.fasta myData.bam | java -jar VarScan.v2.2.jar pileup2snp

Multiple samples:
samtools mpileup -f reference.fasta sample1.bam sample2.bam | java -jar VarScan.v2.2.jar pileup2snp
